# How to Run the AI Waste Segregation App

## Prerequisites
Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit library
- pydeck library (for the map visualization)
- Any other dependencies you may have used in your `app.py`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnupHMuralidhar/WasteSegregation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. The app should now be running locally. You can access it through your browser at:
   ```txt
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

## Try the AI Model

After launching the app, you'll be able to select landfills and view information about them. If you'd like to try the AI model for waste segregation, simply click on the link provided in the app.

The app uses a local Streamlit server on port `8502` for the AI segregation page:
